# Next Session Plan (Formerly Unreleased in Changelog) [2025-07-22]

This file outlines the planned tasks and historical unreleased changes for the project.

## Planned for Next Session
- **Component Refactoring:** Create a reusable `ActionButtons.vue` component for Edit/Delete actions in data tables.
- **Architectural Improvement:** Develop a `useCrud` composable function to abstract and reuse CRUD logic across different modules (Products, Suppliers, etc.).
- **UI/UX Enhancement:** Improve page layout and visual consistency by integrating `n-card` for content sections.

## Historical Changes (Unreleased)

### Changed
- **Products View (`ProductsView.vue`):**
  - Refactored the product data table to be fully responsive and standardized.
  - Removed all explicit `width` and `fixed` column properties to allow for automatic, content-based column sizing.
  - Simplified the column definition logic, removing separate configurations for mobile and desktop to create a consistent experience across all devices.
  - Cleaned up the component by removing unused variables and imports related to responsive breakpoints (`isMobile`, `useBreakpoints`).

### Added
- **UI/UX Overhaul:** Began refactoring the main layout for responsiveness and improved user experience.
- **Product Module:** Implemented initial product listing page with data fetching from the backend.
- **Strapi Utilities:** Created a query builder for easier API communication.
- **Core Views:** Created placeholder views for all main modules (Dashboard, Products, Sales, Repairs).
- **Authentication Flow:**
  - Implemented a complete login/logout flow using Pinia for state management.
  - Created `LoginView.vue` and `MainLayout.vue`.
  - Set up route guards to protect authenticated routes.
- **Project Foundation:**
  - Initialized Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript project.
  - Configured Axios, Pinia with persistence, Vue Router, and Naive UI.
  - Established a comprehensive `README.md`.
